# git-migration-with-history

Migrate git host without losing any history, tag or commit

Clone this repo, put the script to the path you want your local clone to be in.

Then create an empty repo on target git host. ( without any initial commits! )

All you need to run ./git-migration.sh and provide dest, src git repo urls and the name of the project.
